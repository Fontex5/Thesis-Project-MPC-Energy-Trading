This project is the basis for the master's thesis on creating a framework for private energy trading in a neighborhood-scale area. The trading is based on a periodic Double Auction.
It consists of two parts: 
1. A simulator to simulate the consumption of the neighborhood and individual households. This simulator also holds the auction in plaintext 
2. A test implementation of the secure double auction based on Partisia Blockchain ZK Rust.
