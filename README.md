This project simulates energy trading among neighborhood residents. A fundamental system for simulating the energy consumption of a neighborhood is created first and will be used as a building block for implementing trading in 2 different ways:
1- Using DLTs and P2P network
2- Using DLTs and MPC (MultiParty Computation)
